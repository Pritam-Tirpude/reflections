When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
>> I will use remote repository when i want to share my project with others and collaborate with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
>> Because I created a new file in github repository, so i have to tell the git that the new commits have been encountered and pull that 
>> new commit in my local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
>> fork means the same as we are cloning the repository on our local computer but what fork does in GitHub is that if there's somebody who
>> wants to share his/her  project with others than who wants to contribute to  that project can fork his/her project directly on GitHub
>> cloneing the project in git is the same as fork in GitHub, we can work offline after cloning the project on our computer same as fork
>> Branching makes easier to track changes on another branch rather than on our officuial branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
